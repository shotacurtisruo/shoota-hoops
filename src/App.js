        <h1>Hi this is Shota.</h1>
        <p>I am currently a student at UC Davis studying computer science. This might make you wonder - well then why am I offering free basketball lessons? As a student, I am often spending my time coding or studying. However my love for basketball still lingers.  My passion for basketball started during middle school, which then eventually led to me playing during high school. Now in college, basketball no longer could be a priority due to academics. 
          So I thought to myself: how can I do both? This is where I came up
          with the idea of providing free lessons for the youth and community while using my web developing skills to create this page. 
          I truly believe that basketball is more than just a game; it's a powerful medium that forges lifelong friendships, teaching teamwork, trust, and camaraderie both on and off the court.
